Get a quiuck overview of today's weather and the upcoming forecast.

Here's why:
* You need to know what the weather will be like today.
* You want to be able to check weather at various destinations. 
* You can't plan ahead without a forecast of the weather for the week. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
